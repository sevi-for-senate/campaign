            My name is Sevi Alvarez. I grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina, to a working
            class family. For most of my childhood, we hovered near the poverty line. When I was in my 20s, my
            father had a stroke, and I spent seven years caring for him. Eventually, we found other arrangements
            for him, and I was able to finish college. I got my Master's degree in Accounting from the
            University of North Carolina at Charlotte (Go Tarheels!) in 2015, and around that time I met
            Liz.<br><br>
            We got married in 2018, and soon after, we moved to Spartanburg to be closer to my stepdaughter,
            Joanna, who attends Spartanburg Day School. In 2020, my wife gave birth to our son Benjamin, and I
            transitioned from being an accountant to a full time stay at home dad (I kept my CPA license,
            though).<br><br>
            In late 2022 I was diagnosed with Stage 3 intestinal cancer. I spent most of 2023 fighting it off,
            and today I am cancer-free and fully recovered.</h3>

                        <p class="card-text">I believe that abortion is the civil rights issue of our time. Safe,
                            accessible, and legal abortions are of paramount importance in our state. More than that,
                            though, I believe that EVERY South Carolinian has a God-given right to make their own
                            medical decisions, without the state butting in and telling them what they can and can't do.
                            When I was receiving cancer treatment, no one told me that this or that medication was
                            legal, or that a procedure was banned for reasons irrelevant to my own wellbeing. I want
                            those rights to extend to everyone.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">I had good insurance as I battled cancer, but many South Carolinians are
                            not so
                            lucky. Hundreds of thousands have no coverage at all, and many more would still be
                            bankrupted by a cancer, a car crash, or even a diabetes diagnosis. It is imperative that
                            South Carolina expand Medicaid, bringing much-needed coverage and resources for those who
                            need it the most.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">There is a childcare crisis in the United States, and South Carolina is
                            among
                            the worst offenders. Daycare for infants and toddlers can cost upwards of $900 per month;
                            meanwhile, the median income for childcare workers is barely higher than minimum wage. This
                            has caused a deficit of talent that results in unreasonable waiting lists, especially for
                            parents who are caught off guard by it. We must work toward subsidizing some, if not all, of
                            these costs, and increasing the minimum wage - at least for daycare workers, if not for
                            everyone in our state.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">We need to ensure that our streets and neighborhoods are
                            safe and walkable. We need to speed up housing construction in some places and slow it down
                            in others, and we need at least some of it to be affordable. We need to get rid of outdated
                            and unsafe structures in neighborhoods that have been neglected for too long. I want to work
                            hard to direct some much-needed funding into Spartanburg County for all these purposes and
                            more.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Did you know that Boiling Springs isn't actually a city? That's why
                            development
                            has been so out of control lately, and it's a big reason why traffic is so bad in that area.
                            The folks who live in Boiling Springs need better representation, and they need the ability
                            to create zoning ordinances that will slow the uncontrolled growth over there to a more
                            manageable level.</p>
