                <h2 style="color: #123180; font-weight: bolder;">Who I Am, and Where I Came From</h2>
                <p style="color: #A64253;">My name is Sevi Alvarez. I grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina, to a working
                    class family. For most of my childhood, we hovered near the poverty line. When I was in my 20s, my
                    father had a stroke, and I spent seven years caring for him. Eventually, we found other arrangements
                    for him, and I was able to finish college. I got my Master's degree in Accounting from the
                    University of North Carolina at Charlotte (Go Tarheels!) in 2015, and around that time I met
                    Liz.<br><br>
                    We got married in 2018, and soon after, we moved to Spartanburg to be closer to my stepdaughter,
                    Joanna, who attends Spartanburg Day School. In 2020, my wife gave birth to our son Benjamin, and I
                    transitioned from being an accountant to a full time stay at home dad (I kept my CPA license,
                    though).<br><br>
                    In late 2022 I was diagnosed with Stage 3 intestinal cancer. I spent most of 2023 fighting it off,
                    and today I am cancer-free and fully recovered.</p>

                        <h4>Medical Freedom</h4>
                        <p id="answer-1">I believe that abortion is the civil rights issue of our time. Safe,
                            accessible, and legal abortions are of paramount importance in our state. More than that,
                            though, I believe that EVERY South Carolinian has a God-given right to make their own
                            medical decisions, without the state butting in and telling them what they can and can't do.
                            When I was receiving cancer treatment, no one told me that this or that medication was
                            legal, or that a procedure was banned for reasons irrelevant to my own wellbeing. I want
                            those rights to extend to everyone.

                        <h4>Expand Medicaid</h4>
                        <p id="answer-2">I had good insurance as I battled cancer, but many South Carolinians are not so
                            lucky. Hundreds of thousands have no coverage at all, and many more would still be
                            bankrupted by a cancer, a car crash, or even a diabetes diagnosis. It is imperative that
                            South Carolina expand Medicaid, bringing much-needed coverage and resources for those who
                            need it the most.

                        <h4>Access to Childcare</h4>
                        <p id="answer-3">There is a childcare crisis in the United States, and South Carolina is among
                            the worst offenders. Daycare for infants and toddlers can cost upwards of $900 per month;
                            meanwhile, the median income for childcare workers is barely higher than minimum wage. This
                            has caused a deficit of talent that results in unreasonable waiting lists, especially for
                            parents who are caught off guard by it. We must work toward subsidizing some, if not all, of
                            these costs, and increasing the minimum wage - at least for daycare workers, if not for
                            everyone in our state.

                        <h4>Improve Infrastructure</h4>
                        <p id="answer-4">Spartanburg County recently voted to extend a penny sales tax, and that will go
                            a long way toward improving the roads around here. However, infrastructure is about more
                            than just pavement and bridges. We need to ensure that our streets and neighborhoods are
                            safe and walkable. We need to speed up housing construction in some places and slow it down
                            in others, and we need at least some of it to be affordable. We need to get rid of outdated
                            and unsafe structures in neighborhoods that have been neglected for too long. I want to work
                            hard to direct some much-needed funding into Spartanburg County for all these purposes and
                            more.

                        <h4>Incorporate Boiling Springs Into a Municipality</h4>
                        <p id="answer-5">Did you know that Boiling Springs isn't actually a city? That's why development
                            has been so out of control lately, and it's a big reason why traffic is so bad in that area.
                            The folks who live in Boiling Springs need better representation, and they need the ability
                            to create zoning ordinances that will slow the uncontrolled growth over there to a more
                            manageable level. And they're not the only ones who will benefit; the creation of city
                            limits will help prevent urban sprawl from overtaking the rural character of Northern
                            Spartanburg County, and giving Boiling Springs its own police force will reduce the burden
                            on the Sheriff's Office. Insurance premiums will also go down, not to mention more
                            affordable services such as trash and recycling pickup. This has been long overdue for
                            years, and whether elected or not, I intend to lead the charge on getting this ball rolling.
